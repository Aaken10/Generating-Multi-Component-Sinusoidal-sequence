# Digital Signal Processing

a)A MATLAB program  to  generate a multi-componentsinusoidal  sequence with six odd harmonics. Assume the fundamental frequency is 50 Hz.Determine the period of each sinusoidal sequence sampled at Fs>2*Fmax from the plot. 

b)Show the stem plot of the 60 ms discrete-time sequence.

c)Now, generate the same sequence with 4 different sampling frequenciesand point out the differences.

d)Perform a linear shift by 5 ms.

This program is written in MATLAB R2021a. All output Graphs of Sinusoidal sequence with grid plots can be referred for each parts as labelled below.
